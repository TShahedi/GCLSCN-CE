## GCLSCN-CE
Green Closed-Loop Supply Chain Optimization in Tire Industry with Cannibalization Effect Analysis
This project addresses the optimization of a green closed-loop supply chain network (GCLSCN) for automotive tires, focusing on the interplay between new and remanufactured products. The research highlights the impact of cannibalization on the tire industry and presents two mathematical models for location-inventory-pricing. These models aim to maximize profit while minimizing environmental impact, considering the cannibalization effect (CE). The first model, a non-linear mixed integer mathematical programming (MINLP) with a linear demand-price function, and the second, a MINLP with an inverted-U demand-price function, are solved using the augmented epsilon constraint method2 (Augmecon2) for small and medium-sized problems, and the meta-heuristic algorithm NSGA-II for large-sized problems.

### Key Features
Two sophisticated MINLP models addressing the challenges of the green closed-loop supply chain in the tire industry.
Exploration of the cannibalization effect and its impact on profit and environmental factors.
Implementation of Augmecon2 for smaller problems and NSGA-II in Python for larger, more complex scenarios.
An in-depth analysis of the interrelation between pricing decisions, demand, and environmental impact.

### Installation and Usage Instructions
Ensure you have GAMS installed for running the MINLP models.
Python environment setup is necessary for the NSGA-II algorithm. Install the required libraries as per the provided requirements.txt file.
Follow the instructions in the code comments to set up your problem instances and run the models.
Analyze the output to understand the trade-offs between profitability and environmental impact under different scenarios.
